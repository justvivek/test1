Setup SSH key....

So, you have created your account at github and now you want to work with it from your terminal.

Before you start installing Github, you should set up ssh keys:

    $cd ~/.ssh

    if it says "bash: cd: ./.ssh:No such file or directory",it means its not generated and  you should continue with step 2. But if it changes to ~/.ssh directory,  continue from step 3.
    open your terminal any type

     $ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@youremail.com"

    you will get following lines: 'Generating public/private rsa ket pair. Enter file in which to save the key(/Home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa):' just press enter now it will ask you to enter passphrase note that passphrase you enter must be >4, otherwise you will have to repeat whole process again.
    Backup and remove existing SSh keys type 'ls' it should show you some files like now type these following commands one by one 
    
$ mkdir key_backup
$ cp id_rsa* key_backup
$ rm id_rsa*

 Adding your ssh key to Github

$gedit id_rsa.pub

copy its entire content. Open github site and login. go to “Account Settings” > Click “SSH Public Keys” > Click “Add another public  key” an paste it  into "key field". then press Add key.
